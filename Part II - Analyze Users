I used and RFM method to analyze the behavioral segmaentation of thecustomers.
I skipped the Recency anf I focued on the Frequency and Monetary.
The results are ahown on the table in the dashboard here https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/7949a1f7-4817-49a8-8b93-887482870419/page/37LwC/edit
I used a query in SQL that is included in this repo as Query Part III.
I also read reports and watch videos about Food Delivery Marketing and RFM method for customer segmentaion.

I, also, created histograms with specific ranges for Frequency and Order Value.
The range of the bars are selected based ot he min and max, median and average values of the 2 metrics in combination with 
common sense and the assumption that a the smaller order can be placed for 0.5 euros according to the data.

Target groups tah cold be communicated to Marketing Team as target groups are the order_ids with Frequency = 100 and Monetary >90.
This numbers are a first proposal. The Marketing Team could also investigate the rest of the order_ids and decide to waht extend the loyalty should be promoted.
