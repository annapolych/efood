The target groups that could be eligible for loyalty are the following:

Top-level of Loyalty - the IDs g in Order Segmentation and h in Order Values Segmentation.
This group of users includes only 100 values in Frequency Metric and seems to group the most frequent users that could order more than one time per day. 
Super Loyals that need to be awarded accordingly!

Second Level of Loyalty - the IDs with g option in Order Segmentation and g,f,e, and d  in Order Values Segmentation.
This group of users includes only 100 values in Frequency Metric but with a smaller Order Value. Super Loyals!

Third Level of Loyalty - the IDs with f in Order Segmentation and all option in Order Values Segmentation.
This group of users includes ID that orders almost every day. 
They are definitely Loyals.

Fourth Level of Loyalty - the IDs with e in Order Segmentation and g, h option in Order Values Segmentation. 

Fifth Level of Loyalty - the IDs with d option in Order Segmentation and f, g, h option in Order Values Segmentation. 

Sixth Level of Loyalty - the IDs with c option in Order Segmentation and e,f, g, h option in Order Values Segmentation. 

Seventh Level of Loyalty - the IDs with b option in Order Segmentation and d,e,f, g, h option in Order Values Segmentation. 

For the last Target Group, a more detailed selection of Frequency and Order Value could be applied using the Frequency and Monetary Filters.
A more detailed selection could be applied to all Groups using the Frequency and Monetary Filters according to the Marketing Team plan.

Finally, there are 3 users that range from 686 to 543 euros and 114 - 85 orders. It is a Target Group where the IDs probably correspond to companies and they should be further investigated.
